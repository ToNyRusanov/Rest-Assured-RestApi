# Rest-Assured-RestApi

This is a maven project for testing a REST web services using a Rest Assured library.

### What is REST Assured?

REST Assured is a Java DSL for simplifying testing of REST based services,(but it can be used for testing a SOAP based services too) built on top of HTTP Builder.REST-assured provides a lot of nice features, such as DSL-like syntax, XPath-Validation, Specification Reuse, easy file uploads and with those features we will handle automated API testing much easier. 
It supports POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH and HEAD requests. Rest-Assured library also provides ability to validate the HTTP Responses received from server. For e.g. we can verify the Status code, Status message, Headers and even the Body of the response. This makes Rest-Assured a very flexible library that can be used for testing.
